Muon - a new kind of rts

Muon is a real time strategy game under heavy development and with a rather
unusual twist - it has no mobile units. You win the game by conquering the
map using buildings only.

The buildings in the game are:

 * Generator:	Your core building, generates energy which is essential for
		the gameplay. If your generator is destroyed, you are doomed.
 * Pylon:	Re-distributes energy from the generator and extends your
		powergrid. All buildings must be within range of the powergrid
		to function.
 * Scout:	A watch tower with long line of sight and weak firepower, used
		to explore the map.
 * Attacker:	A military building used to take down enemy structures
 * Wall:	The wall blocks the enemies' powergrid and prevent their
		mobilization over the map

Special buildings can be built on map strategic points (control points).
These are:

 * Conyard:	The constrution yard cuts your building times. The more
		construction yards you have, the faster can you build.
 * Missile silo:The missile silo gives you the cluster bomb special ability
		that can be launched on any visible location on the map.
		The more silos you have, the shorter cooldown.
 * Radar:	The radar exposes any part of the map for a short period of
		time. The more radars you have, the shorter cooldown.


Note to developers:
If you are allergic to fugly code, hate quick and dirty hacks, think function
pointers are an abomination or curse upon lack of comments or documentation:
please walk away now. You will not like what you are about to see.
If nothing of the above bothers you however, you are more than welcome to
have a look!
