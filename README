Muon - a new kind of rts

Muon is a real time strategy game under heavy development and with a rather
unusual twist - it has no mobile units. You win the game by conquering the
map using buildings only.

The buildings in the game are:

 * Generator:	Your core building, generates energy which is essential for
		the gameplay. If your generator is destroyed, you are doomed.
 * Pylon:	Re-distributes energy from the generator and extends your
		powergrid. All buildings must be within range of the powergrid
		to function.
 * Scout:	A watch tower with long line of sight and weak firepower, used
		to explore the map.
 * Attacker:	A military building used to take down enemy structures
 * Wall:	The wall blocks the enemies' powergrid and prevent their
		mobilization over the map
 * Buildsite:	The buildsite is a structure which can only be built on map
		strategic points that you take control over, providing you
		with faster building


Note to developers:
If you are allergic to fugly code, hate quick and dirty hacks, think function
pointers are an abomination or curse upon lack of comments or documentation:
please walk away now. You will not like what you are about to see.
If any of the above however does not bother you, you are more than welcome to
have a look!
