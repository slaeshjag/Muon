Muon – a new kind of RTS
=========================

*Muon* is a real time strategy game currently under heavy development. The
game has an unusual twist – there are no moving units. To win the game,
you must conquer your opponent using only static buildings!

The game is fairly minimalistic but offers many opportunities for cunning
plans, tricks and tactical badassery. Games are usually not long, but very
intense. Because of the lack of movable units, you will need to make sure
that every building counts!

Are you going to outsmart your enemy, sneaking into the back of their base
to snipe their generator silently? Or are you going to go for a map full of
construction yards and overpower your enemy by sheer numbers, like a flood
wave? Or are you looking for that technological advantage that can just be
gained with a few cluster bombs delivered with surgical precision?

Buildings
---------

There are five normal buildings in the game:

 *  You start with a **Generator** and you cannot build a new one. This
    building generates energy for all of your other buildings, and
    without it, the war is lost!

 *  The **Pylon** picks up weak energy signals and amplifies them. This
    essentially provides an extension to the power field which all of
    your buildings depend on. Buildings do not function properly if not
    within range of a Pylon or the Generator.

 *  The **Scout** is a basic fighting unit and watch tower. The Scout is
    very effective for exploring the map or forcing your will during
    simple territorial disputes.

 *  The **Attacker** is a strong military building armed to its teeth.
    An Attacker is effectively applied when a situation takes a turn
    for the exceptionally hairy.

 *  The **Wall** doesn't look like much, but it is solid as a rock and
    cancels out the enemies power grid, which prevents their further
    mobilisation across the terrain.

There are also three special buildings which can be placed on a few
strategic points (control points) on the map.

 *  The **Conyard** is a construction yard which works diligently with your
    building construction, cutting down on your building times. The more
    construction yards you have, the faster you can build.

 *  The **Missile Silo** gives you the ability to drop a devastating
    cluster bomb anywhere on any visible location of the map. The more Silos
    you have, the faster in succession can you drop the bombs.

 *  The **Radar** gives you the ability to expose any part of the map for a
    short period of time. The more radars you have, the faster in succession
    can you reveal parts of the map.


Note to developers
------------------

If you are allergic to fugly code, hate quick and dirty hacks, think function
pointers are an abomination or curse upon lack of comments or documentation:
please walk away now. You will not like what you are about to see.
If nothing of the above bothers you however, you are more than welcome to
have a look!
