Muon -- a new kind of RTS
=========================

*Muon* is a real time strategy game currently under heavy development. The game has an unusual twist -- there are no moving units. To win the game, you must conquer your opponent(s) using only static buildings.

The game is fairly minimalistic but offers many opportunities for cunning plans, tricks, tactical badassery and promises adrenaline-fueled quick decision making action. You could distract the enemy on the front as you sneak into their base and snipe their generator silently, but maybe you are going for a map full of construction yards to overpower your enemy by sheer numbers. Or are you looking for that technological advantage that can only be gained with a few cluster bombs delivered with surgical precision?

Only you shape your destiny on the battle field. The games are usually not long, but very intense. Because of the lack of movable units, you will need to make sure that every building counts!


How to play
-----------

When you start a game, you'll find yourself with at least a generator, and possibly more buildings than that. The number and type of buildings you start with is map dependant, so you will have to shape your initial tactics after what you are given. Be sure to examine the mini map to see if there are any buildings you start with that you don't immediately see -- these could provide useful objectives for you.

You need to guard your generator well; a player is eliminated once their generator is destroyed.

The first step in this case, when you start only with a generator, could be to extend your power field (indicated by a white line if you select the generator, or if you have toggled "always show power field" in the options.) To do this, you need to build a Pylon. Start building a Pylon by pressing the Pylon button to the right.

A progress bar will tick up until it reaches 100%, when the building is done. Press the button again to start choosing where you want to place the building. An outline of the building will follow your cursor, and then press on the ground where you want the building placed.

Once you have placed the building, it is done! In this case, my power field got extended a bit. I also gained vision over parts of the map that were previously obscured. Almost all buildings provide some level of vision of the map.

With the power field extended, it might be a good idea to take a look around. This is done by constructing Scouts. The scouts also provide a rudimentary defense, as they are basic fighting units in addition to scouting units. Construct scouts with a process similar to when you constructed the Pylon.

The two scouts have increased my vision by a fair bit; even so far that I can see a strategic point on the map. This square on the map gives you further tactical advantage over your opponents -- unless they have found similar points of their own!

My goal becomes one of exploiting this point I immediately extend my power grid far enough to be able to build Battle Support buildings on it. Battle support buildings can only be built on one of these strategic points.

To build battle support, click the Battle Support button and a submenu will appear. On this menu, you can choose between the different battle support buildings to build. You might want to deploy a radar to gain information on your enemy easier. Information is key in any conflict.

When the radar is built, the radar button on the left will start becoming active. When it is fully active, you can click on it and then anywhere on the battle field to deploy a scanner sweep. This will reveal everything on that area of the map for a limited time.

We see the enemy progressing to the <CARDINAL DIRECTION>, so we better defend ourselves there.

Here, there are two options. We could either fill the place with Scouts, hoping to grind down the enemy Scouts, or we could build a few Attackers, which will make short work of whatever Scouts the enemy has amassed. The choice is yours!


Strategy
--------

Although the goal is to eliminate all enemy players by destroying their generators, you will find that this is not always possible. The game rewards deliberate fortifying of territory on the map, and once fortified, territory is difficult for anyone else to conquer.

This leads to an interesting meta-game, where you will need to feign moves on enemy territory so that they fortify their position in the wrong place, when you have a completely different goal. A lot of times, you also have to realise that you can't both have your cake and eat it -- a lot of interactions in Muon go on a give-and-take basis. You let the enemy invade a little of your territory in exchange for another tactical advantage.

Sometimes, you will probably reach a point in the game where it seems like no side is gaining any ground. When you reach a stalemate, the polite thing to do is to resign. Resignation during a stalemate does not mean that you have lost, it simply means that the game has ended and the winner is determined by the score.


Unit reference
--------------

There are five normal buildings in the game:

 *  You start with a **Generator** and you cannot build a new one. This
    building generates energy for all of your other buildings, and
    without it, the war is lost!

 *  The **Pylon** picks up weak energy signals and amplifies them. This
    essentially provides an extension to the power field which all of
    your buildings depend on. Buildings do not function properly if not
    within range of a Pylon or the Generator.

 *  The **Scout** is a basic fighting unit and watch tower. The Scout is
    very effective for exploring the map or forcing your will during
    simple territorial disputes.

 *  The **Attacker** is a strong military building armed to its teeth.
    An Attacker is effectively applied when a situation takes a turn
    for the exceptionally hairy.

 *  The **Wall** doesn't look like much, but it is solid as a rock and
    cancels out the enemies power grid, which prevents their further
    mobilisation across the terrain.

There are also three special buildings which can be placed on a few
strategic points (control points) on the map.

 *  The **Conyard** is a construction yard which works diligently with your
    building construction, cutting down on all of your building times. The
    more construction yards you have, the faster you can build.

 *  The **Missile Silo** gives you the ability to drop a devastating
    cluster bomb anywhere on any visible location of the map. The more Silos
    you have, the faster in succession can you drop the bombs.

 *  The **Radar** gives you the ability to expose any part of the map for a
    short period of time. The more radars you have, the faster in succession
    can you reveal parts of the map.
