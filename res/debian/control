Description: Minimalistic real time strategy game
 Muon is a real time strategy game currently under heavy development.
 The game has an unusual twist â€“ there are no moving units. To win the game,
 you must conquer your opponent using only static buildings!
 .
 The game is fairly minimalistic but offers many opportunities for cunning
 plans, tricks and tactical badassery. Games are usually not long, but very
 intense. Because of the lack of movable units, you will need to make sure that
 every building counts!
